# Italy-Quality-Life-2021

In this project I recreated the ranking of the Italian provinces for the life's quality made by Il Sole 24 Ore every year.
More specifically, I recreated the ranking with different synthetic indicators comparing to the Il Sole 24 ore ones: the synthetic indicators I used are the Pena Distance (DP2) and the Mazziotta-Pareto Index, instead of the mean value of the indicators used by Il Sole 24 Ore.
As we can see by the results, the rankings are actually different.
